**5x Revenue Increase!**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Trial Limitations

**✅ What Works**:
- Tracks usage locally in browser
- Prevents autofill after 5 uses
- Shows upgrade prompts
- Clear upgrade path

**❌ What Doesn't Work**:
- Users can bypass by clearing extension data
- No server-side enforcement
- Can't track users across devices
- No fraud prevention

### For Production

To prevent abuse, consider:

1. **Device Fingerprinting**
   - Track by browser fingerprint
   - Limit trials per device

2. **Email Verification**
   - Require email for free trial
   - Track by email address

3. **Backend API**
   - Server-side usage tracking
   - Prevent data manipulation

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - IP-based trial limits
   - Email verification required
