# Hired Always - Subscription Setup Guide

Your product has been converted to a **$9.99/month subscription model** using PayPal Subscriptions.

## üö® IMPORTANT: Create PayPal Subscription Plan First

Before the purchase page will work, you **MUST create a subscription plan** in your PayPal Business account.

## üìã Step 1: Create PayPal Subscription Plan

### Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard

1. **Login to PayPal Business**: https://www.paypal.com
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí Click your profile ‚Üí **Account Settings**
3. **Navigate to**: **Products & Services** ‚Üí **Manage Products** (or directly visit: https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/products/subscriptions)

### Create New Subscription Product

1. Click **"Create a Product"** or **"Create Plan"**
2. **Product Type**: Select **"Subscription"**
3. **Fill in details**:
   - **Product Name**: Hired Always Monthly Subscription
   - **Product Description**: AI-powered job application assistant - Monthly access
   - **Product Type**: Digital Products
   - **Category**: Software

4. **Create Plan**:
   - **Plan Name**: Monthly Plan
   - **Plan ID**: `P-HIRED-ALWAYS-MONTHLY` (use exactly this)
   - **Billing Cycle**: Monthly
   - **Price**: $9.99 USD
   - **Setup Fee**: None
   - **Trial Period**: None (or add 7-day free trial if desired)

5. **Advanced Settings**:
   - **Billing Cycles**: Unlimited (until customer cancels)
   - **Payment Failure**: Suspend subscription after 3 failed payments
   - **Auto-renewal**: Enabled

6. **Save the Plan**

### Get Your Plan ID

After creating the plan, PayPal will give you a **Plan ID** that looks like:
- Format: `P-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
- Example: `P-5ML4271244454362WXNWU5NQ`

**CRITICAL**: Copy this Plan ID!

## üìù Step 2: Update Your Code

Open `website/purchase.html` and replace the placeholder Plan ID:

**Find this line (around line 266):**
```javascript
'plan_id': 'P-HIRED-ALWAYS-MONTHLY', // You need to create this plan in PayPal dashboard
```

**Replace with your actual Plan ID:**
```javascript
'plan_id': 'P-5ML4271244454362WXNWU5NQ', // Your actual Plan ID from PayPal
```

## üéØ What's Been Changed

### Subscription Model
- **Price**: $9.99/month (was one-time $9.99)
- **Billing**: Monthly recurring via PayPal
- **Cancellation**: Users can cancel anytime in PayPal
- **Key Format**: `HA-SUB-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

### Files Modified

1. **website/purchase.html**
   - PayPal Subscription Buttons (not regular buttons)
   - Generates `HA-SUB-` prefixed keys
   - Shows monthly billing info
   - Links to PayPal subscription management

2. **popup.js** (Extension)
   - Changed from license to subscription verification
   - 31-day validity period check
   - Shows days remaining
   - Expired subscription warning
   - Links to renewal

3. **popup.html**
   - "Subscription Active" instead of "Licensed"
   - "Manage Subscription" button
   - Days remaining indicator
   - Renewal links

4. **website/index.html**
   - All CTAs updated to "$9.99/month"
   - "Subscribe" instead of "Purchase"
   - "Cancel anytime" messaging

## üîÑ User Subscription Flow

### Initial Subscription
1. User visits `hiredalways.com/purchase.html`
2. Enters email
3. Clicks "Subscribe with PayPal"
4. Completes PayPal subscription setup
5. Receives subscription key: `HA-SUB-XXXXXXXXXXXX`
6. Enters key in extension ‚Üí Activated for 31 days

### Monthly Renewal
1. PayPal automatically charges $9.99 monthly
2. **IMPORTANT**: Extension uses client-side 31-day check
3. After 31 days, extension shows "Subscription Expired"
4. User must re-enter key or renew (limitation of frontend-only)

### Cancellation
1. User goes to PayPal.com ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Manage Automatic Payments
2. Finds "Hired Always" subscription
3. Clicks "Cancel"
4. Subscription ends at current period
5. Extension stops working after 31 days from last activation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations (Frontend-Only)

Since this is a **frontend-only implementation** without a backend server:

### What Works ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ PayPal subscription creation
- ‚úÖ Monthly billing by PayPal
- ‚úÖ Subscription key generation
- ‚úÖ 31-day client-side validation
- ‚úÖ PayPal subscription management

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- ‚ùå **Automatic renewal detection** - Extension can't detect when PayPal renews subscription
- ‚ùå **Real-time cancellation detection** - Extension doesn't know if user cancelled in PayPal
- ‚ùå **Multi-device sync** - Key works on any device, can't limit to one
- ‚ùå **Usage tracking** - No way to track active subscribers
- ‚ùå **Automatic expiration** - Extension expires after 31 days regardless of PayPal status

### The Problem

**After 31 days, the extension will show "Expired" even if the PayPal subscription is still active.**

Users will need to:
1. Get a new subscription key (not ideal)
2. Contact support to get refreshed key
3. OR you implement a backend (recommended)

## üîß Recommended: Add Backend (Production)

For a production subscription service, you should implement:

### Backend API Endpoints
```
POST /api/verify-subscription
  - Input: { subscriptionKey, subscriptionID }
  - Checks PayPal subscription status via API
  - Returns: { active: true/false, expiresAt: date }

POST /api/webhook/paypal
  - Receives PayPal webhooks
  - Updates subscription status in database
  - Handles: subscription.created, subscription.cancelled, payment.sale.completed
```

### Database Schema
```sql
subscriptions:
  - subscription_key (unique)
  - subscription_id (PayPal ID)
  - email
  - status (active/cancelled/expired)
  - started_at
  - expires_at
  - last_payment_at
```

### Extension Changes
```javascript
// Check with backend API instead of local date
async function checkSubscription() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.hiredalways.com/verify', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ subscriptionKey })
  });
  return response.json(); // { valid: true, expiresAt: "2025-11-25" }
}
```

## üí∞ Revenue & Analytics

### Track Revenue
- **PayPal Dashboard**: https://www.paypal.com/reports
- View: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Export: Transaction reports

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| MRR | Active Subscribers √ó $9.99 |
| Churn Rate | Cancelled / Total Subscribers |
| LTV | Avg Subscription Length √ó $9.99 |

### Example
- 100 active subscribers = $999/month MRR
- 500 active subscribers = $4,995/month MRR
- 1,000 active subscribers = $9,990/month MRR

## üß™ Testing Subscription Flow

### Test Mode (Sandbox)

1. **Create Sandbox Accounts**: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts
2. **Create Sandbox Plan** in test mode
3. **Update purchase.html**:
   ```html
   <!-- Change SDK URL to sandbox -->
   <script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID&vault=true&intent=subscription"></script>
   ```
4. **Test complete flow** without real charges

### Live Testing
