# AI Job Application Autofill Chrome Extension

## üöÄ Overview

This Chrome extension is designed to streamline the job application process by automatically filling out forms. It uses your saved personal and professional information, combined with the power of Google's Gemini AI, to intelligently answer a wide variety of questions, from standard text inputs to complex dropdown menus. The extension reads your PDF resume to provide contextually aware answers, saving you time and effort.
