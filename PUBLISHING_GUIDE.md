# Publishing Guide - Hired Always v3.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Before Publishing

### Critical Step - Clean Up popup.js

**Status**: popup.js still contains old subscription code that needs to be removed.

**What to remove from popup.js:**

1. **Delete these functions** (search and delete entirely):
   - `validateSubscriptionKey()`
   - `isSubscriptionExpired()`
   - `checkSubscription()`
   - `manageAdVisibility()`
   - `showLicenseModal()`
   - `hideLicenseModal()`
   - `window.deactivateLicense()`

2. **Delete these event listeners**:
   ```javascript
   // Find and delete:
   document.getElementById('manageLicense').addEventListener(...)
   document.getElementById('activateLicense').addEventListener(...)
   document.getElementById('licenseModal').addEventListener(...)
   ```

3. **Replace subscription checks**:
   ```javascript
   // FIND:
   const subscriptionStatus = await checkSubscription();
   manageAdVisibility(subscriptionStatus.isPaid);

   // REPLACE WITH:
   const appStatus = await AppManager.getStatus();
   const licenseInfoEl = document.getElementById('licenseInfo');
   if (licenseInfoEl) {
       UIUtils.showFreeBadge(licenseInfoEl);
   }
   ```

4. **Test the extension** after changes:
   - Load unpacked in Chrome
   - Check for console errors
   - Test autofill functionality
   - Test tracker functionality
   - Test save/load data
